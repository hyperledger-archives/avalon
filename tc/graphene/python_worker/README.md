# Hyperledger Avalon Python Worker for Graphene SGX

## Introduction
* Avalon python worker implementation is based on [EEA Trusted Compute Specification](https://entethalliance.github.io/trusted-computing/spec.html).
* [Graphene Library OS](https://graphene.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) supports running unmodified Linux applications on Intel SGX. A Library OS (or "LibOS") provides an Operating System environment in a user space library to execute an application.
* Avalon python worker supports execution of python workloads inside a docker container (without Intel SGX) and also in Graphene-SGX environment.
* Avalon python worker uses [pycryptodomex](https://pypi.org/project/pycryptodomex/) package for encryption and [ecdsa](https://pypi.org/project/ecdsa/) package for signing and verification.

## Design Assumptions

- Avalon python worker can run as a standalone docker based application and is not dependent on core Avalon framework for building and running the application.
- Avalon python worker consists of generic classes for work order processing , worker encryption, signing and hash calculation. These classes support work order execution based on EEA Trusted Compute Specification v1.1. These functionalities will eventually be part of Avalon Python SDK and once a formal Avalon Python SDK is released, Avalon python based workers can directly use this SDK.
- Avalon python worker and workloads can be run unmodified in Intel SGX using Graphene Library OS.
- Avalon python worker can be easily extended to support additional python workloads.
- Avalon Graphene Enclave Manager and python worker communicates using JSON-RPC via TCP socket. This implementation uses ZMQ socket to send and receive JSON-RPC messages.
- Avalon python worker docker image can be transformed to graphene based docker image using [Graphene Shielded Containers](https://github.com/oscarlab/graphene/blob/master/Documentation/manpages/gsc.rst) (GSC) tool. GSC tool includes the Graphene Library OS, Intel SGX related information, and executes the application inside an Intel SGX enclave.

## Building and Running the worker without Intel SGX

- To build Avalon Python worker run the following command from [python_worker](https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/tree/master/examples/graphene_apps/python_worker) directory:

  `docker-compose build`

  This will create docker image *avalon-python-worker-dev*. This image contains Avalon python worker, sample workloads and a test application to send work order to python worker.

### Test python worker using test client (without Avalon)

- To run python worker as a docker container and to use a test application to send work order requests,  execute the following command from [python_worker](http://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/tree/master/examples/graphene_apps/python_worker) directory.

  `docker-compose up` 

  Above command will run test work orders listed in file [*test_work_orders.json*](http://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/tree/master/examples/graphene_apps/python_worker/tests/test_work_orders.json).

## Building and Running the worker in Graphene SGX

- Before building and running application for Graphene-SGX, we need to install Intel SGX driver and Graphene SGX driver.

  - To install Intel SGX driver please refer https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/blob/master/PREREQUISITES.md#intel-sgx-in-hardware-mode
  - Clone the Graphene codebase from [here](https://github.com/oscarlab/graphene.git) if not done already. Then, to install Graphene SGX driver please refer https://graphene.readthedocs.io/en/latest/building.html#install-the-graphene-sgx-driver-not-for-production.

- To build Avalon Python worker docker image for Graphene-SGX we need to use [Graphene Shielded Container](https://github.com/oscarlab/graphene/tree/master/Tools/gsc) (GSC) tool. Please refer to [GSC tool documentation](https://github.com/oscarlab/graphene/blob/master/Documentation/manpages/gsc.rst) for detailed instructions to create graphene based docker image from application docker image.

- To build graphene based docker image, we need the non-SGX docker image *avalon-python-worker-dev* built earlier and [Graphene manifest files]( https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/tree/master/examples/graphene_apps/python_worker/graphene) for python worker.

- To retrieve a valid quote from Graphene-GSX enclave, update the manifest file by providing correct SPID and linkable value in *sgx.ra_client_spid* and *sgx.ra_client_linkable*. You can subscribe SPID from https://api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/EPID-attestation

- Run the following command from Graphene git repository root directory:

  1. Create GSC build configuration file using following commands :

     `cd Tools/gsc`

     `cp config.yaml.template config.yaml`

     *# Adopt config.yaml to the installed Intel SGX driver and desired Graphene repository.
        Since Graphene is under rapid development, checkout stable version to avoid issues*

     *# Avalon Python worker uses below configuration*.

     ```
     Distro: "ubuntu18.04"
     Graphene:
         Repository: "https://github.com/oscarlab/graphene.git"
         Branch: "5ba470800d50f7449d582a1162924b9df33cce7b"
     SGXDriver:
         Repository: "https://github.com/01org/linux-sgx-driver.git"
         Branch: "sgx_driver_2.6"
     ```

  2. Copy the Graphene python worker GSC build script file *build_gsc_python_worker.sh* from [here](https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/tree/master/examples/graphene_apps/python_worker/graphene) to <graphene_repo>/Tools/gsc using following command :

     `cp <path of build_gsc_python_worker.sh> Tools/gsc`

  3. Set *TCF_HOME* to the top level directory of your avalon source repository.

     `export TCF_HOME=<path of avalon repo top level directory>`

  4. Graphenize Avalon python worker docker image using following command :

     `./build_gsc_python_worker.sh`

  Above command if run successfully will generate a Graphene based docker image *gsc-avalon-python-worker-dev*.

### Test python worker using test client (without Avalon)

- To run python worker as a docker container in Graphene-SGX environment and to use a test application to send work order requests, execute the following command from [python_worker](http://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/tree/master/examples/graphene_apps/python_worker) directory.

  `docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml -f compose/graphene-sgx.yaml up`

  Above command will run test work orders listed in file [*test_work_orders.json*](http://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/tree/master/examples/graphene_apps/python_worker/tests/test_work_orders.json).
