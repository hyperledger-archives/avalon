        Get Encryption Key Request Payload
        Inputs
        1. worker_id is an id of the worker to retrieve an encryption key for.
        2. last_used_key_nonce is an optional nonce associated with last retrieved key.
        If it is provided, the key retrieved should be newer than this one. Otherwise any key can be retrieved.
        3. tag is tag that should be associated with the returned key, e.g. requester id.
        This is an optional parameter. If it is not provided, requesterId below is used as a key.
        4. requester_id is an id of the requester that plans to use the returned key to submit
        one or more work orders using this key.
        5. signature_nonce is an optional parameter and is used only if signature below is also provided.
        6. signature is an optional signature of concatenated workerId, lastUsedKeyNonce, tag, and signatureNonce.
        The hashing and signing algorithms are defined in hashingAlgorithm and encryptionAlgorithm for the Worker

        Output
        1. worker_id is an id of the worker that created the encryption key.
        2. encryption_key is an encryption key.
        3. encryption_key_nonce is a nonce associated with the key.
        4. tag is tag associated with the key.
        5. signature is a signature generated by the worker. The hashing and signing algorithms are defined in
        hashingAlgorithm and encryptionAlgorithm for the worker as defined in section Common Data for All Worker Types.
        The signature is calculated as follows:
            -> a hash is calculated over the concatenation of workerId, encryptionKey, encryptionKeyNonce, and tag.
            -> the hash is signed by the worker's signing key corresponding to verificationKey defined in Appendix A.
            -> the hash is formatted as BASE64 string.
