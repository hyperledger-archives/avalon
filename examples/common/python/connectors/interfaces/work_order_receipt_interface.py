        -> By the Work Order Receipt creator (requester)
        -> By other participants, e.g. to acknowledge the Work Order results
        in case of multi-party Work Order processing
        Inputs:
        1. work_order_id is the id of the Work Order.
        2. updater_id is an id of the updating entity. It is optional, if it is
        the same as the transaction sender address.
        3. update_type is a type of the Work Order update that defines how the
        update should be handled.
        If update_type is from 0 to 255, the update sets the receipt status to
        update_type value, refer to Creating a Work Order Receipt in case of
        all other types, the processing is application specific

        'workOrderStatus` as follows:
        If the update sets the Work Order Receipt status to completed or
        processed, it is a hash value of the Work Order Response in all other
        cases, update_data are application specific

        work_order_id, update_type, and update_data. It is required only if the
        updaterId is not the same as the transaction sender address. Hashing
        and signing algorithms are defined by signature_rules.
        6. signature_rules defines hashing and signing algorithms, that are
        separated by forward hash '/', e.g. "SHA-256/RSA-OAEP-4096". It is an
        optional parameter and it is required if signing algorithms are
        different from the algorithms defined for the Worker defined during
        the receipt creation.
