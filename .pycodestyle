# For now, disable these pycodestyle checks.
# Maintainers should endeavor to investigate and remove these for
# maximum pycodestyle coverage.

# Note: Disabling the following checks is temporary. Maintainers should
# check for these errors with new code using pycodestyle.

# E126 continuation line over-indented for hanging indent
# E128 continuation line under-indented for hanging indent
# E722 do not use bare except
# W191 indentation contains tabs
# W503: line break before binary operator

# For now, allow lines <=127.
# Python Style Guide "PEP 8" recommends lines <=79 characters.
# New code should be limited to 79 character lines
