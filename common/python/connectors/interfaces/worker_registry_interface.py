        Initiating Worker lookup
        This function retrieves a list of Worker ids that match the input
        parameters.
        The Worker must match all input parameters (AND mode) to be included
        in the list.
        If the list is too large to fit into a single response (the maximum
        number of entries in a single response is implementation specific),
        the smart contract should return the first batch of the results

        combination to select Workers.

        Inputs
        1. worker_type is a characteristic of Workers for which you may wish
        to search
        2. organization_id is an id of an organization that can be used to
        search for one or more Workers that belong to this organization

        retrieve the rest of the ids.
        2. lookup_tag is an optional parameter. If it is returned, it means
        that there are more matching Worker ids that can be retrieved by
        calling function workerLookUpNext with this tag as an input parameter.
