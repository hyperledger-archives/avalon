Hyperledger Avalon in General
=============================

What is Hyperledger Avalon?
---------------------------
Hyperledger Avalon enables privacy in blockchain transactions, moving
intensive processing from a main blockchain to improve scalability and latency,
and to support attested Oracles.

What is the Off-Chain Trusted Compute Specification?
----------------------------------------------------
The Off-Chain Trusted Compute Specification (TCS) defines off-chain
compute transactions that can be computed in private and trusted to be correct.
These transactions may or may not be associated with a blockchain.
Avalon implements the TCS.

The TCS is defined by the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) Task Force and
is at
https://entethalliance.github.io/trusted-computing/spec.html

What is the difference between Proxy Mode and Direct Mode?
----------------------------------------------------------
Proxy Mode is where the requester (client) executes a smart contract
(or chaincode or similar) on the blockchain.
The smart contract event invokes Avalon and Avalon executes an
Avalon workload processor through the Blockchain Connector
interface for that blockchain platform (Ethereum, Fabric, etc.).
Direct mode is where the requester (client) operates directly with
Avalon workload processors (via the HTTP JRPC listener), without a blockchain.

How is Avalon source code licensed?
-----------------------------------
As with all Hyperledger projects, Avalon is Apache 2.0 licensed.
Apache 2.0 is a permissive license that allows reuse of the software,
including commercial use.

- `Hyperledger Avalon Proposal (Eugene Yarmosh et al., 2019)
  <https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=16324764>`_

Do you have a developers forum?
-------------------------------
Yes, we host it biweekly online using
`Zoom <https://zoom.us/>`_ at
https://zoom.us/my/hyperledger.community.backup
(meeting ID 622-333-6701).
For details see:
https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/avalon/topic/68762393
or
https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/avalon/Hyperledger+Avalon

What is Trusted Compute Framework (TCF)?
----------------------------------------
*TCF* is the former name for Hyperledger Avalon.

How do I add a question and answer to this FAQ?
-----------------------------------------------
File a Pull Request (PR) against this file in the
Avalon source code. See
https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

How do I raise a defect or a new feature request to the Hyperledger Avalon community?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You can log any new feature request OR issues/defects you find with the
Avalon code here:
https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/issues

How many nodes does Avalon support?
-----------------------------------
One, specifically the Avalon blockchain connector that connects to
a blockchain node. In the future Avalon will support processing
multiple work orders in parallel, but there will still be one connector.
No other Avalon component connects to the blockchain.

Another Avalon instance unrelated to any other Avalon instance may connect
independently to the blockchain.

What synchronization modes does Avalon Support?
-----------------------------------------------
The Off-Chain Trusted Compute Spec has three modes (asynchronous,
notify, and synchronous). Avalon currently supports async mode.
Synchronous mode using ZMQ is available for Singleton Mode workers. 

Is the LMBD database available for application use?
---------------------------------------------------
No, that is not the intention. LMDB is dedicated for internal use by Avalon.
Application data can be stored in a separate database or in files.
The only potential external use that should be made of LMDB is by an
Avalon hosting service for its monitoring and administration tools.

Is there a mechanism to auto-trim the LMDB database?
----------------------------------------------------
Avalon is supposed to auto-trim LMDB after exceeding a maximum threshold
by removing old entries. It may not be fuly implemented yet,
but that is the plan. There is also an explicit API to delete a specific
workorder, so the orchestrator app can explicitly remove completed workorders.
This is especially useful to remove large, obsolete responses so as to not
exhaust the database. This API mitigates the LMDB size but is not intended as
a replacement for auto-clean up.

In the future, a clean up tool may be added.

Does Avalon support a Library OS (LibOS)?
-----------------------------------------
Avalon does not support a LibOS now, but support is planned in the future,
initially with Graphene.

Does the Avalon Enclave Manager support multiple workers?
---------------------------------------------------------
Currently Avalon is hard-coded to suport one Enclave worker.
Support for multiple workers running in parallel is planned in the future.

How can Avalon workers coordinate in Direct Mode (without a blockchain)?
------------------------------------------------------------------------
In Proxy Mode, Avalon workers can coordinate with blockchain entries.
In Direct Mode, one possible solution is to write a
"coordinator" or "governor" worker that acts as a trusted server and stores
any global registry information (such as data access rights and dataset keys)
required by all the enclave workers.
In essence this mimics blockchain functionality through some sort of
distributed database or ledger.


Installation and Configuration
==============================

How do I install and configure Avalon?
--------------------------------------
- First setup your environment by following the instructions at
  https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/blob/master/PREREQUISITES.md
- Then build and install Avalon by following the instructions at
  https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/blob/master/BUILD.md

How to I resolve a build error for Avalon?
------------------------------------------
- First thing to do is check the version of your Ubuntu distribution.
  Currently, Avalon supports Ubuntu LTS 18.04 ("bionic").
- Next is check the versions of dependent libraries:
  OpenSSL and Intel SGX SDK and Driver versions are often incorrect.
- Also check the troubleshooting sections at
  https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/blob/master/PREREQUISITES.md
  and
  https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/blob/master/BUILD.md
  to see if your error is mentioned.
- Often a clean build solves problems, or, better yet,
  cloning a new repository to remove build artifacts.
- You can also post a question on the mailing list or chat channel:
  `mailing list <https://lists.hyperledger.org/g/avalon>`_
  or the
  `chat channel <https://chat.hyperledger.org/channel/avalon>`_

How do I fix this error installing Avalon on Azure ACC with Intel SGX: "/dev/isgx": no such file or directory
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Azure Confidential Computing (ACC) installs the ``/dev/sgx`` driver
on their cloud instances with Intel SGX.
Avalon uses ``/dev/isgx`` instead.
So if you use Avalon with Intel SGX hardware mode enabled
on ACC without ``/dev/isgx`` installed you get this error:

   .. code:: none

       ERROR: for avalon-sgx-enclave-manager  Cannot start service
       avalon-sgx-enclave-manager: error gathering device information while
       adding custom device "/dev/isgx": no such file or directory

The fix is to remove ``/dev/sgx`` then install ``/dev/isgx``
For instructions on how to do tis, see "Intel SGX in Hardware Mode" at
https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/blob/master/PREREQUISITES.md#sgx

How can I make a worker from use old keys when I restart a KME or a Singleton worker?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
By default, workers use fresh set of signing and encryption key pairs (asymmetric keys) across
restarts. Sealed data from respective worker enclaves are used to recover keys across restarts.
However, the default behavior does not allow recovery from sealed data. This behavior can be
overridden if old pairs of aforementioned keys are desired. For this, it has to be ensured that
the sealed data created during previous startup of the enclave manager (KME or Singleton) is not
cleaned up before starting again. This has been provisioned in the docker mode already. Prepend
``CLEAN_SEALED_DATA=0`` to the docker-compose command. For example -

   .. code:: none

       CLEAN_SEALED_DATA=0 docker-compose up -d

You could also update the value of ``CLEAN_SEALED_DATA`` to ``0`` in the ``.env`` file at project root directory.


Software Development
====================

How do I build Avalon?
----------------------
- Follow the instructions to setup your build environment at
  https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/blob/master/PREREQUISITES.md
- Then build
  https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/blob/master/BUILD.md
- Intel SGX is not required to build or use Avalon.

Where are the Avalon libraries?
-------------------------------
Avalon libraries are provided in source form at
https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/
and must be compiled.
The enclave libraries are in subdirectory ``tc/sgx/`` .
Client libraries are under ``examples/common``
with example client applications under ``examples/apps/``

What's the relationship between workload and worker?
----------------------------------------------------
- *Workload* - Your business logic
- *Worker* - A framework component which distributes work to the workloads

Do you have example applications?
---------------------------------
Yes, at
https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/tree/master/examples/apps

Do you have programming tutorial?
---------------------------------
Yes, there is a simple Avalon worker application tutorial at
https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/tree/master/docs/workload-tutorial


Is there a way to get more info about an execution?
---------------------------------------------------
Using ``export TCF_DEBUG_BUILD=1`` might help. See
https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/blob/master/PREREQUISITES.md#environment
Also look at the Avalon Listener and Enclave Manager output.
The output goes to the terminal. It can be redirected to a file if needed.

Must I use C++ to write application as a workload?
--------------------------------------------------
For now only C++ is supported for workers.
However, any other language can be added.
There was a PR to add Java, for example.

What TCP ports does Avalon use?
-------------------------------
- TCP 1947: connections to Avalon listener from Avalon clients.
  The URL is ``http://localhost:1947/`` or, for Docker,
  ``http://avalon-listener:1947/``
- TCP 9090: connections to LMDB listener for KV Storage.
  The URL is ``http://localhost:9090/`` or, for Docker,
  ``http://avalon-lmdb:9090/``
- TCP 5555: ZMQ connections to Avalon Enclave Manager from Avalon Listener.
  This is used by Avalon singleton enclave workers using Synchronous Mode.
  The URL is ``tcp://localhost:5555`` or, for Docker,
  ``tcp://avalon-enclave-manager:5555``
- TCP 7777: ZMQ socket port used by Avalon Graphene Enclave Manager
  to communicate with Graphene Python Worker.
  The URL is ``tcp://localhost:7777`` or, for Docker,
  ``tcp://graphene-python-worker:7777``
- TCP 1948: connections to Avalon Key Management Enclave (KME).
  Used only for Worker Pool Mode (not Singleton Mode).
  The URL is ``tcp://localhost:1948`` or, for Docker,
  ``tcp://avalon-kme:1948``

What cryptography does Avalon use?
----------------------------------
See
https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/blob/master/tc/sgx/common/crypto/README.md

I get multiple Error 5 messages after submitting a work order: ``Work order is computing. Please query for WorkOrderGetResult to view the result``
-------------------------------------------------------------------
That's normal operation. Currently only pull model is implemented by Avalon.
The client is expected to call ``WorkOrderGetResult`` periodically to poll
the work order result.

Where are error codes defined?
------------------------------
See file
https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/blob/master/common/python/error_code/error_status.py
For example, workorder error 5 is ``PENDING``.

How is the JRPC Request ID in work orders used?
-----------------------------------------------
The ``jrpc_req_id`` is used to verify the context of a response received after
posting a JRPC request.
We recommend using a UUID for the request ID.
Currently it is not being verified in Avalon's SDK as the communication is over
HTTP and only a single call is included in each call.
When there is significant traffic, multi-call JRPC requests might be possible
in a single HTTP request. This field would play a role there to map requests
to responses. A shift from HTTP (synchronous request-response) would also
require proper handling of this field.

What does this error mean: ``avalon_sdk.http_client.http_jrpc_client] operation failed: [Errno 99] Cannot assign requested address``?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The requester (client) could not communicate with the Avalon Listener.
This could be caused by Avalon Listener not running or by not specifying the
URI of the Avalon Listener. The default URI for the Avalon Listener is
``http://localhost:1947`` .
If using Docker, specify the URI as the name of the Docker container running
the Avalon Listener:  ``http://avalon-listener:1947`` on the
command line (the option is usually ``--uri`` or ``--service-uri``).

Why do I see ``RuntimeError`` when I make changes to trusted code in enclave managers (KME or Singleton) and try to run?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
An error stack similar to the one below can be seen if changes are made to the trusted
code and the enclave manager (KME or Singleton) is restarted without cleaning sealed data.

   .. code:: none

       [02:28:05 ERROR   avalon_enclave_manager.base_enclave_manager] failed to initialize/signup enclave;
       Traceback (most recent call last):
       ...
       ...
       RuntimeError

Note that this is only the beginning and end of the error stack. This happens because some
sealed data from respective enclave is used across enclave lifetimes now. The way out of
this is to remove the sealed data before starting again. Be cautious before you do this
beacause this would result in creating fresh pair of signing and encryption keys discarding
the older ones.


Docker and Containers
=====================

What is the purpose of using Docker, and what does it have to do with Intel SGX? I mean, are Intel SGX enclaves running in containers?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Docker is used only as a convenience. It has nothing to do with the Avalon
security model or Intel SGX enclaves. Docker makes it easier to
build and setup Avalon, but you can also build without Docker
(although it requires several more steps).

How do I fix this docker-compose error: ``Invalid interpolation format for "build" option``
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Your docker-compose is too old. Version 1.17.1 works OK.

How do I open a TCP port in Docker?
-----------------------------------
With the ``ports:`` line. For example, if you want to open TCP port 1947, used by the
Avalon Listener, to the outside world (outside the host and Docker containers), add these
two lines in your ``docker-compose.yaml`` file (or similarly named file)

   .. code:: none

       ports:
        - "1947:1947"

This allows you to connect to TCP port 1947 from the host or external to the host.
Beware that this may allow access to port 1947 from the outside world (Internet)
if your firewall rules allow it. You can also map the port to another port on the host.
For example, ``- "80:1947"`` maps Docker port 1947 to host port 80 (http).

There is a similar line (``expose:``) that opens up ports between Docker containers on the
internal Docker container network. This should already be present:

   .. code:: none

       expose:
        - 1947

Why are some Docker Compose .yaml files in $TCF_HOME and others in $TCF_HOME/docker/compose?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The usual convention is to have a default ``docker-compose.yaml`` file
in the base source directory so that a newbie can just run the command
``docker-compose up`` and a bare minimal setup should be running.
The other flavors of .yaml files, be it for proxy or worker pool,
have been moved from $TCF_HOME to ward off confusion and cluttering
in the base source directory.

What is the equivalent of "make clean" using Docker build?
----------------------------------------------------------
The closest to that is running ``git clean`` to remove all generated files.

TEEs and IntelÂ® SGX
===================

What is a Trusted Execution Environment?
----------------------------------------
A Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) is a secure area of a processor.
It ensures code and data is kept secure from the outside environment
and maintains integrity of input and output with authentication.

A TEE can be thought of as a "reverse sandbox". A traditional sandbox
restricts the software from accessing system or external resources on a
machine (such as a Java VM). A TEE "reverse sandbox" or enclave keeps the
system--other applications and even the OS kernel--from
accessing data inside the enclave.
Intel SGX is a hardware implementation of a TEE and is supported by Avalon.

Is Intel SGX required to use Avalon?
------------------------------------
No. You can use the Intel SGX simulator to simulate a TEE.
In the future we plan to add other trusted workers such as
other hardware TEEs, MPC (multi-party compute), and
ZK (zero-knowledge proofs).

What is the working principle of Intel SGX TEE Workers?
-------------------------------------------------------
At high level you design an application so the core business part resides in
the enclave, ensuring that even if your untrusted part is compromised the
trusted part cannot be.

Intel SGX is a set of instructions that increases the security of application
code and data, giving them more protection from disclosure or modification.
Developers can partition sensitive information into Intel SGX enclaves,
which are areas of execution in memory with more security protection.

The PDF link at this webpage gives a good technical overview of Intel SGX
enclaves:
https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2016/06/06/overview-of-intel-software-guard-extension-enclave

How can I create a TEE with Intel SGX using Avalon?
---------------------------------------------------
Start with the examples and tutorial at https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon/tree/master/docs#tutorial
The technical details of Intel SGX enclaves are encapsulated in the
Avalon libraries and Avalon Enclave Manager.
If you want to learn about low-level details, I would look at the
Intel SGX SDK and example programs.

I get the message ``intel_sgx: SGX is not enabled`` in ``/var/log/syslog``
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Intel SGX needs to be enabled in BIOS.

Is there a maximum size of input data when using Intel SGX?
-----------------------------------------------------------
Avalon does not expect application-specific code to use Intel SGX sealed data.
Avalon uses sealed data internally for storing private enclave signing and
encryption keys.
As result application specific data size is not dependent on the sealed data
storage.
It is indirectly limited by the maximum Enclave Page Cache (EPC) size
(enclave includes both data and code).
The maximum EPC size is limited to 128 Mbytes on Intel Xeon E3 and
256 Mbytes on Intel Xeon E Mehlow-R.
The EPC can be bigger but it results in swapping in and out of the enclave,
which greatly slows things down.

Is there a SDK for work order submissions?
------------------------------------------
We do not have a client SDK for Avalon yet which can be used by Avalon clients
to submit work order requests to Avalon. So there is no formal documentation
available. The Client SDK for Avalon is work in progress.
The Generic client uses some utility functions to create and submit work order.
Documentation is currently limited to code comments.

When starting Avalon with Intel SGX why do I get an error SGX_ERROR_BUSY from the Avalon Listener?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you are behind a corporate proxy, make sure you have ``proxy type`` and
``aesm proxy`` lines set in ``/etc/aesmd.conf`` .
This file may be overwritten if you reinstall Intel SGX SDK.

How do I know I am in Intel SGX Hardware Mode?
----------------------------------------------
If you set ``SGX_MODE=HW`` in your environment and setup Intel SGX correctly,
Avalon will startup in Intel SGX Hardware Mode.
You know you are in Intel SGX Hardware Mode (SGX_MODE=HW) when you see messages
similar to this in the Avalon Enclave Manager output at startup:

   .. code:: none

       INFO avalon_enclave_manager.base_enclave_info] Running in Intel SGX HW mode
