# Building Hyperledger Avalon

In order to build, install, and run Hyperledger Avalon
a number of additional components must be installed and configured.
The following instructions will guide you through the installation and build
process for Hyperledger Avalon.

You have a choice of [Docker-based build](#dockerbuild)
or a [Standalone-based build](#standalonebuild).
The Docker-based build is recommended.

# <a name="dockerbuild"></a>Docker-based Build and Execution
Follow the instructions below to execute a Docker-based build and execution.

1. Install Docker Engine and Docker Compose, if not already installed.
   See [PREREQUISITES](PREREQUISITES.md#docker) for instructions
2. Build and run the Docker image from the top-level directory of your
   `avalon` source repository.

   **Intel SGX Simulator mode (for hosts without Intel SGX)**:
   1. Run `sudo docker-compose up --build`
   2. For subsequent runs on the same workspace, if you changed a
      source or configuration file, run the above command again
   3. For subsequent runs on the same workspace, if you did not make any
      changes, startup and build time can be reduced by running:
      `MAKECLEAN=0 sudo -E docker-compose up`

   **SGX Hardware mode (for hosts with Intel SGX)**:
   1. Refer to Intel SGX in Hardware-mode section in
      [PREREQUISITES document](PREREQUISITES.md) to install SGX pre-requisites
      and to configure IAS keys.
   2. Run `sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-sgx.yaml up --build`
   3. For subsequent runs on the same workspace, if you changed a
      source or configuration file, run the above command again
   4. For subsequent runs on the same workspace, if you did not make any
      changes, startup and build time can be reduced by running:
      `MAKECLEAN=0 sudo -E docker-compose -f docker-compose-sgx.yaml up`
3. On a successful run, you should see the message `BUILD SUCCESS`
   followed by a repetitive message `Enclave manager sleeping for 10 secs`
4. Open a Docker container shell using following command
   `sudo docker exec -it tcf bash`
5. To execute test cases refer to [Testing](#testing) section below
6. To exit the TCF program, press `Ctrl-c`


# <a name="standalonebuild"></a>Standalone Build
## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Standalone: Prerequisites
Follow the [PREREQUISITES document](PREREQUISITES.md) to install and configure
components on which Hyperledger Avalon depends.

## <a name="installtcf"></a>Standalone: Installing Avalon Using Scripts
This section describes how to get started with Avalon quickly using provided
scripts to compile and install Avalon.
The steps below will set up a Python virtual environment to run Avalon.

1. Make sure environment variables are set as described in the
   [PREREQUISITES document](PREREQUISITES.md)

2. Download the Avalon source repository if you have not already done this:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/avalon 
   cd avalon
   ```

3. Set `TCF_HOME` to the top level directory of your
   `avalon` source repository.
   You will need these environment variables set in every shell session
   where you interact with Avalon.
   Append this line (with `pwd` expanded) to your login shell script
   (`~/.bashrc` or similar):
   ```bash
   export TCF_HOME=`pwd`
   echo "export TCF_HOME=$TCF_HOME" >> ~/.bashrc
   ```

4. If you are using Intel SGX hardware, check that `SGX_MODE=HW` before
   building the code.
   By default `SGX_MODE=SIM` indicating use the Intel SGX simulator.
   if you are not using Intel SGX hardware, go to the next step.

   Check that `TCF_ENCLAVE_CODE_SIGN_PEM` is set.
   Refer to the [PREREQUISITES document](PREREQUISITES.md)
   for more details on these variables.

   You will also need to obtain an Intel IAS subscription key and SPID
   from the portal
   https://api.portal.trustedservices.intel.com/
   Replace the SPID and IAS Subscription key values in file
   `$TCF_HOME/config/tcs_config.toml` with the actual hexadecimal values
   (the IAS key may be either your Primary key or Secondary key):

   ```bash
   spid = '<spid obtained from portal>'
   ias_api_key = '<ias subscription key obtained from portal>'
   ```

   In the same file, if you are behind a corporate proxy,
   uncomment and update the https_proxy line:

   ```bash
   #https_proxy = "http://your-proxy:your-port/"
   ```
   If you are not behind a corporate proxy (the usual case),
   then leave this line commented out.


5. Create a Python virtual environment, and build and install Avalon
   components into it:
   ```bash
   cd $TCF_HOME/tools/build
   # Create virtual environment directory with name _dev
   python3 -m venv _dev
   sudo make clean
   make
   ```

6. Build the Client SDK Python module:

   ```bash
   cd $TCF_HOME/client_sdk
   python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
   pip3 install dist/*.whl
   ```

7. Build the LMDB listener and shared key/value storage modules:

 
   ```bash
   cd $TCF_HOME/examples/shared_kv_storage/db_store/packages
   mkdir -p build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   cd $TCF_HOME/examples/shared_kv_storage
   make
   make install
   ```

8. Activate the new Python virtual environment for the current shell session.
   You will need to do this in each new shell session (in addition to
   exporting environment variables).
   ```bash
   source $TCF_HOME/tools/build/_dev/bin/activate
   ```
   If the virtual environment for the current shell session is activated,
   you will the see this prompt: `(_dev)`

# <a name="testing"></a>Testing

Once the code is successfully built, run the test suite to check that the
installation is working correctly.
Follow these steps to run the `Demo.py` testcase:

**NOTE**: Skip step 1 in the case of Docker-based builds, since
`docker-compose.yaml` will run the TCS startup script.

1. For standalone builds only:
   1. Open a new terminal, Terminal 1
   2. `cd $TCF_HOME/scripts`
   3. Run `source $TCF_HOME/tools/build/_dev/bin/activate` .
      You should see the `(_dev)` prompt
   4. Run `./tcs_startup.sh`
   5. Wait for the listener to start. You should see the message
      `TCS Listener started on port 1947`,
      followed by a repetitive message `Enclave manager sleeping for 10 secs`
   6. To run the Demo test case, open a new terminal, Terminal 2
   7. In Terminal 2, run `source $TCF_HOME/tools/build/_dev/bin/activate`.
      You should see the `(_dev)` prompt
2. For Docker-based builds:
   1. Follow the steps above for
      ["Docker-based Build and Execution"](#dockerbuild)
   2. Terminal 1 is running `docker-compose` and Terminal 2 is running the
      "tcf" Docker container shell from the previous build steps
3. In Terminal 2, run `cd $TCF_HOME/tests`
4. In Terminal 2, use this command to run the `Demo.py` test:
   ```bash
   python3 Demo.py --input_dir ./json_requests/ \
           --connect_uri "http://localhost:1947" work_orders/output.json
   ```
5. The response to the Avalon listener and Intel&reg; SGX enclave Manager can be
   seen at Terminal 1
6. The response to the test case request can be seen at Terminal 2
7. If you wish to exit the Avalon program, press `y` and `Enter` at Terminal 1
   for standalone builds.
   For Docker-based builds, press `Ctrl-c`
8. For standalone mode, delete virtual environment
   ```bash
   rm -rf $TCF_HOME/tools/build/_dev/
   ```

A GUI is also available to run this demo.
See [examples/apps/heart_disease_eval](examples/apps/heart_disease_eval)

## <a name="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting
- If you see the message
  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '...'`, you did not run
  `source _dev/bin/activate`
  or you did not successfully build Avalon

## <a name="troubleshootingstandalone"></a>Troubleshooting: Standalone build
- Verify your [environment variables](PREREQUISITES.md#environment)
  are set correctly and the paths exist
- If the Demo test code breaks due to some error, please perform the following
  steps before re-running:
  1. `sudo rm $TCF_HOME/config/Kv*`
  2. `$TCF_HOME/scripts/tcs_startup.sh -t`
  3. You can re-run the test now

- If you get build errors rerunning `make`, try `sudo make clean` first

- If you see the message `No package 'openssl' found`, you do not have
  OpenSSL libraries or the correct version of OpenSSL libraries.
  See [PREREQUISITES](PREREQUISITES.md#openssl) for installation instructions

- If you see the message
  `ImportError: ...: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`,
  then you need to set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` with:
  `source /opt/intel/sgxsdk/environment` .
  For details, see [PREREQUISITES](PREREQUISITES.md)
