# Building Trusted Compute Framework

In order to build, install, and run Hyperledger Trusted Compute Framework
(TCF), a number of additional components must be installed and configured.
The following instructions will guide you through the installation and build
process for Hyperledger Trusted Compute Framework.

# <a name="dockerbuild"></a>Docker-based Build and Execution
Follow the instructions below to execute a Docker-based build and execution.
1. Build and run the Docker image from the top-level directory of your
   `TrustedComputeFramework` repository.

   **SGX SIM mode**:
   1. Run `sudo docker-compose up --build`
   2. For the subsequent builds on the same workspace, build time can be
      reduced by executing this command:
      `MAKECLEAN=0 sudo -E docker-compose up`

   **SGX HW mode**:
   1. Refer to Intel SGX in Hardware-mode section in
      [PREREQUISITES document](PREREQUISITES.md) to install SGX pre-requisites
      and to configure IAS keys.
   2. Run `sudo docker-compose -f docker-compose-sgx.yaml up --build`
   3. For the subsequent builds on the same workspace, build time can be
      reduced by executing this command:
      `MAKECLEAN=0 sudo -E docker-compose -f docker-compose-sgx.yaml up`
2. On a successful run, you should see the message `BUILD SUCCESS`
3. Open a Docker container shell using following command
   `sudo docker exec -it tcf bash`
4. Activate a virtual environment in the Docker shell using following command
   from the Docker working directory, `$TCF_HOME/tools/build`,
   which is set in the `docker-compose.yaml` file:
   ```
   source _dev/bin/activate
   ```
   If the virtual environment for the current shell session is activated,
   you will the see this prompt: `(_dev)`
5. To execute test cases refer to [Testing](#testing) section below
6. To exit the TCF program, press `Ctrl-c`

# <a name="standalonebuild"></a>Standalone Build
## <a name="prerequisites"></a>Standalone: Prerequisites
Follow the [PREREQUISITES document](PREREQUISITES.md) to install and configure
components on which TCF depends.

## <a name="installtcf"></a>Standalone: Installing TCF Using Scripts
This section describes how to get started with TCF quickly using provided
scripts to compile and install TCF.

First, make sure environment variables are set as described in the
[PREREQUISITES document](PREREQUISITES.md).

The steps below will set up a python virtual environment to install things
into. Set `TCF_HOME` to the top level directory of your
`TrustedComputeFramework` repository.
You will need these environment variables set in every shell session
where you interact with TCF.
```
export TCF_HOME=`pwd`
```

Change to the quickstart build directory:
```
cd $TCF_HOME/tools/build
```

Check that these variables are set before building the code:
SGX_DEBUG, SGX_MODE, SGX_SSL, TCF_ENCLAVE_CODE_SIGN_PEM
Refer to the [PREREQUISITES document](PREREQUISITES.md)
for more details on the above variables.

Build the virtual environment and install TCF components into it:
```
make clean
make
```

Activate the new virtual environment for the current shell session. You will
need to do this in each new shell session (in addition to exporting environment
variables).
```
source _dev/bin/activate
```
If the virtual environment for the current shell session is activated,
you will the see this prompt: `(_dev)`

# <a name="testing"></a>Testing

Once the code is successfully built, run the test suite to check that the
installation is working correctly.
Follow these steps to run the `Demo.py` testcase:

**NOTE**: Skip step 1 in the case of Docker-based builds, since
`docker-compose.yaml` will run the TCS startup script.

1. For standalone builds only:
   1. Open a new terminal, Terminal 1
   2. `cd $TCF_HOME/scripts`
   3. Run `tcs_startup.sh`
   4. Wait for the listener to start. You should see the message
      `TCS Listener started on port 1947`
   5. To run the Demo testcase, open a new terminal, Terminal 2
2. For Docker-based builds:
   1. Follow the steps above for ["Docker-based Build and Execution"](#dockerbuild)
   2. Terminal 1 is running `docker-compose` and Terminal 2 is running the
      "tcf" Docker container shell from the previous build steps
3. In Terminal 2, run `cd $TCF_HOME/tests`
4. In Terminal 2, use this command to run the `Demo.py` test:
   ```
   python3 Demo.py --input_dir ./json_requests/ \
           --connect_uri "http://localhost:1947" work_orders/output.json
   ```
5. The response to the TCF listener and Intel&reg; SGX enclave Manager can be
   seen at Terminal 1
6. The response to the test case request can be seen at Terminal 2
7. If you wish to exit the TCF program, press `y` and `Enter` at Terminal 1
   for standalone builds.
   For Docker-based builds, press `Ctrl-c`

A GUI is also available to run this demo.

## <a name="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting
- If you see the message
  `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '...'`, you did not run
  `source _dev/bin/activate`

## <a name="troubleshootingstandalone"></a>Troubleshooting: Standalone build
- Verify your [environment variables](PREREQUISITES.md#environment) are set correctly and the paths exist
- If the Demo test code breaks due to some error, please perform the following steps
before re-running.
  1. `rm $TCF_HOME/config/KV* `
  2. `pkill -f tcs_listener/tcs_listener.py`
  3. `pkill -f tcs_enclave_manager/tcs_enclave_manager.py`
  4. You can re-run the test now
